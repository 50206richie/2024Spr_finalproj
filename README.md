# Straight or Skew? --- A new puzzle

## Quick start

## Introduction

***
## Targeted Algorithm Analysis
Regardless of which option you choose, you need to describe 
the performance characteristics of some critical parts of your
program and explain why you chose the data structures and core
algorithm(s) you did. Examples, if you chose Type #1, what's 
the Big-O, Big-Theta, or Big-Omega run-time complexity of your 
puzzle solver? Or the puzzle generator?

## Performance Measurement
Supplement the analysis above with run-time measurements 
of multiple iterations of the game or puzzles as discussed 
in class. Sample results from a run-time profiler is a good 
idea at least as part of the measurements.
